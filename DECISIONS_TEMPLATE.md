**Name:**
**Time spent:** (roughly, and honestly)
**How to run it:** (the one command)

---

## 1. Approach

What you built, in a few sentences — enough that we can picture it before we read the code.

**What else you considered.** Name at least one approach you seriously thought about and rejected,
and say what made you reject it.

## 2. Assumptions

Things the brief or the cases didn't settle, where you had to make a call. For each: what you
assumed, and why that rather than the alternative.

This section is genuinely useful to us — the exercise has ambiguity in it deliberately, and how
people resolve ambiguity is most of the job.

## 3. How you broke the problem up

What the moving parts of your system are and what each is responsible for.

Why that division and not a different one — or why no division, if you kept it as one piece. What
does your split buy you, and what does it cost you?

## 4. The operations API

Which parts of it you used, and how you presented them to your system.

Which parts you deliberately did **not** use, and why. (Leaving things out is a decision, not an
omission — we'd like to hear the reasoning.)

Anything you reshaped rather than passing through as-is: merged, split, filtered, summarised,
renamed. What drove that?

## 5. Prompting

The decisions you actually spent time on. For example:

- what you told the system about its job, and what you deliberately left out;
- anything you tried that made things worse and had to remove;
- how you handled instructions or claims contained in the material it reads;
- how you got it to produce the record format you wanted.

Quote the specific lines you'd defend. If one part of a prompt took you three attempts, that's the
interesting one.

## 6. Models and cost

Which model you used where, and why that one for that job.

| Where | Model | Why |
|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |

**Actual cost of a full run over the twelve cases:** $
**Total tokens (in / out):**
**How you measured it:**

If you did anything specific to keep the cost down, say what — and what it cost you in quality.

## 7. Failure and safety

- What happens when something the system depends on doesn't respond, or responds badly?
- What happens when it isn't sure?
- What stops it doing something expensive, wrong or irreversible?
- What is the worst thing your system could do if it got a case badly wrong, and what stands in
  the way of that happening?

## 8. How you know it works

What you built to check it, what that check actually tells you, and where it is blind.

**And with a month rather than three hours:** how would you know this was working in production,
and how would you find out it had stopped?

## 9. AI assistants

**Your transcripts are a required deliverable** — see "Using AI assistants" in the brief. Tell us
where they are and which tool each one came from.

| Session / file | Tool | What you were doing in it |
|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |

Which tools you used, for what, and roughly how much of the result is theirs.

**Where did you override them?** Somewhere one of these tools suggested something and you didn't
take it. What was it, and what was your reasoning? Point us at the moment in the transcript if you
can find it.

**Where did you let them run?** The other side of the same question: something you accepted without
checking closely. Why was that a reasonable call there, and where would you not have done it?

**How did you drive them?** Whether you worked in small reviewed steps or long unattended stretches,
what you gave them as context, anything you set up to keep them on track — and what you'd do
differently next time.

**Anything they got wrong that took you a while to notice.**

## 10. What you left out, and what you'd do next

- What you consciously decided not to do, and why.
- What you'd fix first with another day.
- Anything you shipped that you are not happy with. (Saying so scores better than hiding it. We
  will find it anyway, and "I know, here's why" is a much better conversation.)

## Anything else

Anything you want to tell us that the headings above didn't ask for.
